## Description

This pipeline consists of various Bash and Python scripts, each described in the order they should be executed.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Before running the pipeline, make sure you have installed the following programs: 

* DeepVariant (v1.9.0): https://github.com/google/deepvariant?tab=readme-ov-file
* Samtools (v1.22.1): https://github.com/samtools/samtools
* Python >v3.6


### Installing

If you want to run this pipeline, you can simply clone the github repository using the code below:
```
git clone git@github.com:cbortoluzzi/ROHs.git
```

## Executing program

### Step 1: Call variants using DeepVariant
In this step, you will use DeepVariant to perform variant calling from sequencing reads: 

```deepvariant.sh <reference_genome> <bam> <model>```

**Required inputs:**
- Reference genome (```<reference_genome>```): the reference genome must be in uncompressed .fasta fomrat and indexed. Use the following command to index it:
```samtools faidx <reference_genome>```. 

- BAM file (```<bam>```): the input alignment of an individual. Like the reference genome, the alignment must also be indexed:
```samtools index <bam>```.

- Model type (```<model>```): this specifies the DeepVariant model to use. Use ```WGS``` for Illumina whole-genome sequencing data, ```PACBIO```for PacBio data, or ```ONT_R104``` for Oxford Nanopore R10.4.1 chemistry Simplex and Duplex reads.

**Outputs:**
- VCF file: this is the standard VCF file containing all called variants.
- XML report: a report in XML format generated by DeepVariant containing summary statistics. For more information about the VCF stats report, refer to the DeepVariant documentation: https://github.com/google/deepvariant/blob/r1.9/docs/deepvariant-vcf-stats-report.md. 

**IMPORTANT**: before running the script, make sure to change in the bash script the paths to DeepVariant and the directory where your data is stored.

### Step 2: Calculate genome-wide coverage
In this step, you will use Samtools to compute the genome-wide coverage of each individual alignment file in BAM format: 

```samtools_depth.sh <bam>```

**Required inputs:**
- BAM file (```<bam>```): the indexed alignment file for the individual for which you want to calculate the genome-wide coverage. 

**Output:**
- Coverage file: a text file (```.cov```) reporting the genome-wide coverage. You will need this file in step 3 and 4.  

### Step 3: Filter called variants based on phred-quality score, read depth, and genotype quality
In this step, you will use a python script to filter variants called in step 1. This is an important step to retain high quality variants: 

```
python filter_variants.py -h

Parameters:

    --vcf    This is the VCF file generated by DeepVariant in step 1.

    --cov    This is the text file generated by Samtools in step 2.

    --q      This is the minimum Phred-quality score that a variant must have to be retained (default value: 15).

    --dp     This is the minimum read depth that a variant must have to be retained (default value: 6).

    --gq     This is the minimum genotype quality that a variant must have to be retained (default value: 20).

    --o      This is the name of the output directory where the filtered VCF file will be saved.
```

To run this script, make sure to have the following modules installed in python: 
- ```PyVCF 0.6.8```
- ```pathlib 1.0.1```
- ```subprocess```
- ```argparse```

This script filters variants in the VCF file based on three key parameters: minimum Phred-quality score, minimum read depth, and minimum genotype quality. The parameters ```-q```, ```-dp```, and ```-gq``` allow you to modify the default values for these thresholds.

**You only need to specify these three parameters if you want to change the default settings**. If you are fine with the defaults, you can omit them when running the script.

I recommend reviewing the XML report generated in Step 1 to assess the quality of your data. This report can help you decide if any parameters need adjusting. For example, a default genotype quality of 20 may be too low or too high for your specific dataset, and tweaking it could improve your variant filtering.

**IMPORTANT**: the script also filters variants if their read depth is above 2 x the average genome-wide coverage. If you want to allow for a higher maximum read depth, you will need to manually change the script at line 33. For example, if you want a maximum read depth of 2.5 x the average genome-wide coverage, change line 33 with ```max_depth = 2.5 * float(avg_genome_coverage)```. 

### Step 4: Calculate genome-wide heterozygosity using a window approach
In this step, you will use a python script to calculate a corrected measure of heterozygosity for each individual VCF file, employing a window size approach. 

```
calculate_genome_wide_heterozygosity.py -h

Parameters:

    --vcf    This is the VCF file filtered in step 3.

    --bam    This is the BAM file.

    --cov    This is the text file generated by Samtools in step 2.

    --dp     This is the minimum read depth that a variant must have to be retained (default value: 6).

    --w      This is the window size to use to calculated the corrected measure of heterozygisity (default value: 10,000 bp).

    --o      This is the name of the output directory where the filtered VCF file will be saved.
```

The output file is going to look like the example below: 

```1  0  10000  8765  10
1  10000  20000  7865  16```

where the entries are, in order:
- chromosome
- start position of the window
- end position of the window
- total number of sites meeting our coverage criteria as calculated from the BAM file
- total number of sites meeting our coverage criteria as calculated from the VCF file
- corrected heterozygosity 

The heterozygosity is "corrected" because it adjusts for the number of sites excluded from the 10 Kb window due to failing our coverage criteria. Therefore, if a 10 Kb window has 8765 well-covered sites and 10 well-covered heterozygous sites, the corrected heterozygosity is calculated as:

``` corrected_heterozygosity = (window size / cov_sites_bam ) * heterozygous_sites_vcf = (10000 / 8765) * 10 = 11.41```
